# dogbin

Dogbin is a simple and sweet pastebin and urlshortener, originally based on [hastebin](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) by [John Crepezzi](https://github.com/seejohnrun), but now wielding a completely rewritten python backend and the most beautiful frontend ever (atleast out of the ones I made).

The API however is written to be compatible with any haste client, but with some extended capabilites.

## Run dogbin

1. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/dogbin/server`)
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start dogbin using `python3 -m dogbin` 
4. dogbin should now be running on `localhost:7777`
