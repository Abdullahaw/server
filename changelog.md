* you can now edit who you are, but that's not a dogbin feature. however we now allow you to edit pastes
* a very basic user account system has been created, this is really just barebones (check for yourself on  
  /register and /login
* pastes created using the anonymous, session based account are transfered to your user account upon signing in
 >if you have any pastes you prepared to be editable in the past it is now your chance to create an account 
 >and PM me on telegram or twitter (both @deletescape) so I can transfer ownership of them there.
